Luminium is a state-of-the-art modpack designed for Minecraft creative and Compbuild. 

## Features 
### OptiFine Parity
Luminium supports OptiFine/MCPatcher resource pack features such as CIT and connected textures.

### Maximum Performance
Luminium has Sodium, Nvidium, Iris, and other performance mods to help provide maximum performance. Luminium also offers Bobby which allows for client-side chunk rendering, allowing you take large stunning screenshots on Minecraft servers that have pretty low view distance.

### Compatible with Vanilla
